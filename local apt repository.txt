Server:

sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev  (there maybe lock error so follow this link to fix)
https://itsfoss.com/could-not-get-lock-error/

sudo apt-get install apache2

sudo mkdir /var/www/html/debs
sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html/debs
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/debs/amd64 
sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html/debs/amd64

sudo gedit ~/bin/mydeb1 (creating bash file and can use any folder or name)

( if gedit command not found then..
 sudo apt-get install gedit )

#! /bin/bash
 sudo cp /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb /var/www/html/debs/amd64
 cd /var/www/html/debs/amd64
 dpkg-scanpackages . /dev/null | gzip -9c > Packages.gz

sudo chmod 777 ~/bin/mydeb1 (give permission)

sudo ./mydeb1(run it where mydeb1 exists and run it
every time a new deb file is added)

to see ip adreess:

sudo apt-get install net-tools
ip addr

ip address will be shown at the bottom...that ip address will be used as
source for client

Client :

sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
(if gedit command not found then
sudo apt-get install gedit )

deb [trusted=yes] http://192.168.58.129/debs/amd64 ./ (use ur ip address of server)
**remove or comment out all other sources from client

sudo apt-get update (update every time something new needs to be installed)

then install a package to check if it works (e.g codeblocks which has to be in server)
